# Angr Lib

## Helper functions
 - Run until first symbolic branch
 - Run until memory address
 - Print memory like peda
 - Init memory (zero everything)
 - Display info (funtions with addresses, calls, etc)

## Pre-build hooks
 - Check for string equality


# Angr debugger
## Ideas
 - Has scripting engine, can script like normal angr, then move to interactive mode
 - Debug until branch, then dump assembly on each side
 - 


Eventually turn into r2 plugin, with commands to control execution
