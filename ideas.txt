# Main Script

Choose from stdin, argument, or scanf inputs
Automatically print addresses for different printf/puts options at start
Integrate address chooser with radare2

Solve for address, output, etc

CMU binary has example for storing at memory address

CSCI-4968-MBE has RPI binary exploitation challenges solutions
